# Design your own turtle design!

You must give your turtle at least 10 commands, and try to make something cool!

For tomorrow, you must have (on SEPARATE sheets of paper):
1. Your instructions for your turtle (at least 10)
2. The drawing of what you think your instructions will make your turtle do!

## Reminder
Your turtle can receive the following commands:

Forward(X): Move forward X units
Right(X): Turn right X degrees
Left(X): Turn left X degrees
