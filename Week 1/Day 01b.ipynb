    "- **Change colors**: Replace color names like \"red\" with \"purple\", \"orange\", etc.\n",
    "- **Change sizes**: Modify the `side_length` and other distance variables\n",
    "- **Change speeds**: Adjust the `speed()` values (1=slow, 10=fast)\n",
    "- **Change backgrounds**: Modify `screen.bgcolor()` values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Medium Challenges:\n",
    "- **Draw a hexagon**: 6 sides, 60-degree turns (360¬∞ √∑ 6)\n",
    "- **Draw multiple shapes**: Copy a function and modify it\n",
    "- **Change positions**: Use `turtle.goto(x, y)` to draw shapes in different locations\n",
    "- **Add your initials**: Use turtle commands to draw letters\n",
