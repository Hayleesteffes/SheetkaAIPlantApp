    "*   In addition, some **guidelines** for variable naming are:\n",
    "    *   Python is case-sensitive (`Year` and `year` are two separate variables).\n",
    "    *   Use meaningful variable names (e.g. `year` is more informative than `x`). A good reference is that you should be able to tell what is going on in the code and variables without having to run it.\n",
    "    *   Be consistent in your formatting  (e.g avoid StartYear and Stop_year).\n",
    "    *   Avoid overlap with existing variables and functions (e.g., `print`, `sum`, `str`).\n",
