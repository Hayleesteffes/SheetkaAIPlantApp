## About IndigiGenius

IndigiGenius is an Indigenous-led nonprofit working to increase the representation of Indigenous people in computer science through culturally informed curriculum, programs, and initiatives.

## About The Curriculum

The curriculum incorporated into this repository is derived from activities and lessons learned from the Lakota AI Code Camp (LAICC, [https://lakota.aicode.camp](https://lakota.aicode.camp)). The LAICC began in the summer of 2022 and has been annually hosted at the Black Hills State University campus.

The repository is split into units for supporting students in creating an application powered by a deep learning model, developed using the Python programming language, the fastai library, and Gradio Web Applications. The goal of the current version of this curriculum is to support students in developing an image recognition model that provides information about an object in the Indigenous language of the student participants. The LAICC has sought to support students in collecting image data and cultural knowledge about plants traditionally known to, and used by, the Lakota people, which they can then use to create an application to preserve, disseminate, and appropriately control that information.  

The approach of this curriculum was created using a backwards planning process, beginning with the goal of creating a web-based Computer Vision application. The process for creating a web-based application is grounded in created a Gradio application hosted on Hugging Face (huggingface.co) (Unit 03). In order to create such a web-based application, it is necessary that a .pkl model be created using deep learning techniques. The curriculum leverages the Fast.AI API to create such a model, and the jupyter notebooks necessary to accomplish this task are located in Unit 02. For learners to understand and work within the Fast.AI API, they must first be comfortable with the Python programming language, and so the first unit (Unit 01) is focused on developing the programming skills necessary to work with Python.

## The Process
1. Learners work with activities to develop competency with the Python programming language and jupyter notebooks.
1. Learners use Docker containers, jupyter notebooks, and the fastai library to create a computer vision deep learning model.
1. Learners leverage the computer vision model they created to build a web-based Gradio application hosted on Hugging Face to deploy a tool that educates and disseminates cultural knowledge.

## Getting Started
